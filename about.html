                <p>By education, Eugenia is a teacher and translator of the French language, but the main hobby of her life is the history and culture of Moscow, her native city. As a young woman, Evgenia worked as a tour guide in the house-museum of the famous Russian artist Polenov. Then she became a guide in the company Intourist. She conducted tours in Moscow for French-speaking tourists, and also accompanied French tourists on their trips to the Soviet Union.</p>

                    <p>If you are going to Moscow for the first time, then, probably, first of all, you will be interested to get acquainted with its most famous sights that are included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List, such as the famous Kremlin Fortress and Red Square, which probably everyone saw on the internet, the ancient Novodevichy Monastery, the magnificent Kolomenskoye Park, a wonderful monument of Orthodoxy â€“ the Trinity-Sergius Lavra in Sergiev Posad, which is 75 km from the city.<br>
                    But Moscow is full of other attractions, and it all depends on your personal preferences. Maybe you are interested in getting acquainted with Russian painting, or maybe you want to see a particular area of the city closer, walk along Arbat Street or Zamoskvorechye.

She, of course, will be happy to introduce you to the brightest traditional objects of tourist attention but is also ready to make an individual program or an individual tour according to your wishes.</p>
