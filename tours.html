                <h3>Arbat Street</h3>
                <p>Arbat is not just one of the most ancient streets of Moscow, but it is also a real symbol of the city. The first written mention of this street dates back to the 15th century, and in terms of the number of attractions, Arbat can compete even with Red Square. This street is associated with important historical and cultural events, so this corner of Moscow is worth visiting even for those who came here for just a few days. The street is located in a block that bears the same name, and Moscow residents call it Old Arbat. The name of the street is of Arabic origin and means "suburb" since it was once really a suburb of the White City. I suggest we walk through this suburb together.

                <h3>Zamoskvorechye District</h3>
                <p>Zamoskvorechye is a vast and extremely interesting area of Moscow, located to the south of the Kremlin. Its name suggests that the district is located on the other side of the Moskva River. Here you can see amazing architectural monuments: the Church of St. Nicholas in Pyzhy, the Church of St. Pope Clement, the building of the Tretyakov Gallery and many other historical places. This is one of the favourite places of Muscovites. In recent years, many streets and alleys of Zamoskvorechye have been transformed: wide sidewalks, elegant lanterns, benches, and bicycle paths have appeared here. You will find numerous restaurants, cafes and pubs here.

                <p>This walk starts at the Patriarshy Bridge. We will admire the magnificent panoramas of the Kremlin and Zamoskvorechye, the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and then go for a walk along the ancient Street Prechistenka. This street appeared on the map of Moscow in the 16th century.  Prechistenka was a street where representatives of the aristocracy settled. Their magnificent estates were located on this street, so this part of Prechistenka is called the Moscow suburb of Saint-Honore. Let's walk along the old street and admire the houses, each of which is a gem of architecture and has its own history.

                <h3>Red Square</h3>
                <p>For those who have never been to Moscow, a visit to Red Square will be full of amazing discoveries.  Red Square attracts people with its beauty and its special charm, as well as its historical and political role in the life of the country. In the Old Russian language, Red Square meant a Beautiful Square, but it was originally called "Torzhok", since there was a large market. After the terrible fire of the 17th century, the square was called "Fire", but gradually the name Red Square became official. Its area is about 23,100 square meters. Today, Red Square has become a symbol of Moscow, where military parades are held, holidays and big concerts are organized, and proms are celebrated. I invite you to take a look at the treasures of the main square of the country.<br>

                <h3>State Historical Museum</h3>
                <p>The State Historical Museum, both elegant and majestic, adjacents to the Red Square from the north. The building was built in 1883 in the New Russian style. It was built especially for the museum. Famous artists designed halls of the 1st floor in the style of the collections that were to be placed in these halls. The museum's collection is huge, it has more than 5 million unique exhibits. Here we can get acquainted with Russian history from ancient times to the beginning of the 20th century. Walking the halls of the museum, you will have a much better idea of what the character of the Russian person is based on and what lies at the heart of the great Russian culture.

                <h3>St. Basil's Cathedral</h3>
                <p>Many consider this cathedral the most beautiful and the most mysterious church in Russia. There is a legend that the architects who built the cathedral were blinded so that they could no longer create anything as beautiful. Even Stalin would not allow the cathedral to be destroyed during the anti-religious war of 20-30 years of the XX century. During the Second World War, the cathedral was sheltered from German bombing along with the Kremlin with a huge painted canvas. We will be able to walk with you through the lower and upper levels of the cathedral, to see that inside it looks like a maze in the shape of an eight-pointed star. We will talk about the history of the country and Moscow, the era of Ivan the Terrible, and the features of ancient Russian architecture.

                <h3>The Holy Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra</h3>
                <p>The famous monastery of the Life-giving Trinity was founded by St. Sergius of Radonezh in 1337. Sergius of Radonezh is one of the most revered saints in Russia. It was he who blessed Dmitry Donskoy for the battle with the invaders on the Kulikovo Field and became the founder of the Moscow state. His prayers have kept the walls of the Lavra safe from enemies for centuries. Since childhood, Sergius of Radonezh was destined for a special role â€” the role of a great ascetic. The monastery is a unique architectural ensemble, surprisingly beautiful and colourful. It played a huge role in the history of Russia, so here we can talk about historical events, church architecture, the features of the Orthodox church, and Orthodoxy in general. A picturesque road leads to the monastery, and although it is located 75 km from Moscow, this trip is very interesting, at least because the architectural ensemble of the monastery is included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List.

                <h3>Chambers of the Romanov Boyars</h3>
                <p>The white-stone chambers of the Romanov boyars in the Zaryadye district began to form at the end of the XV century, and in 1597 was already marked in the foreground of the city of Moscow. The chambers belonged to the old Romanov boyars, from whom the second dynasty of the Russian tsars descended after the first dynasty, the Rurikovich dynasty, was interrupted. Today, the chambers are an interesting museum, which recreates the life of the boyar family of the 17th century. Here you can see what the boyar's chambers looked like, talk about the peculiarities of life at that time. The exhibition presents unique items of that era, with which you can vividly imagine the traditional life that was broken and went into oblivion after the European reforms carried out in the late XVII-early XVIII century by Emperor Peter the Great.
